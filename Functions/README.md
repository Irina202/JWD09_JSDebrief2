# Intro
  
A new taxi company has hired you to write some functions for it.  
  
  
First, they would like to you write a function that works out the distance in blocks  
between the company's depot (on 42nd Street) and the customers pickup location (The   company is only interested in north and south, don't worry about east and west).  
For example, if the customer is on 50th Street, the function will need to determine the distance between 50th street and 42nd second street.  
  
  
  
Next, in this city, each block is 264 feet long, we need a function that will take in  
the function from the first step and use it to calculate the distance from the depot to  
the customer's pick up location in feet.  
  
  
  
  
Next, the company want a function that takes in the pick up location (street) and the  
drop off location, once again we are only dealing with North and South, not East and West,  
and calculates the distance travelled in feet for the customers ride.  
  
  
  
Finally, the company would like a function that will calculate and return the fare for the  
customer.  
  
Some additional information that you will require:  
The first four hundred feet are free.  
For a distance between 400 and 2000 feet, the price is 2cents per foot (not including the  
first 400 feet, which are free!)  
Fares between 2000 feet and 2500 feet are charged a flat fare of $  
The company does not allow fares that are over 2500 feet.  
  
Happy coding!
